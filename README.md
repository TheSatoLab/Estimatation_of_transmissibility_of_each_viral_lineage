# Estimatation of transmissibility of each viral lineage

## Summary
To estimate the relative transmissibility of each SARS-CoV-2 lineage, we established a statistical model to represent the epidemic dynamics of each viral lineage based on the viral genomic surveillance data.  

We modelled the transition of the relative frequency of K types of viral lineages with a Bayesian multinomial logistic model as below:
